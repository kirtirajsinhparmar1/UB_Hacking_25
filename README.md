## 🎯 Problem

Banks are legally required to conduct adverse media screening—monitoring negative news about customers, counterparties, and portfolio companies. Current manual processes are:

- ❌ **95% manual**: Compliance analysts Google names and read hundreds of articles
- ❌ **Expensive**: $150-400 per screening with analyst salaries
- ❌ **Slow**: Takes 2-4 hours per entity, delaying approvals
- ❌ **Inconsistent**: Different analysts flag different risks

**Consequences**: Danske Bank ($236B money laundering), Rabobank ($360M fine)
